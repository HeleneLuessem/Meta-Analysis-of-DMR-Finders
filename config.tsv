# A threshold for defining DML. In DML testing procedure, hypothesis test that the two groups means are equal is conducted at each CpG site. Here if ’delta’ is specified, the function will compute the posterior probability that the difference of the means are greater than delta,and then call DML based on that. For general design, this has to be set to 0.
